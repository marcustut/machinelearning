# Fetal Health

This is the first project I have using Weka to do Machine Learning. Since the dataset in `.arff` format is private, 
it is not included in this repository. However, the dataset in `.csv` format can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification) on Kaggle.

The results of the project has ben written as a LaTeX document where the source can be found [here](./report.tex) and a 
PDF version can be found [here](./report.pdf).
